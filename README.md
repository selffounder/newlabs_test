# New Labs
This project aims to help young researchers to come up with their research topics by evaluating their relevance. This is made by a teen researcher Alisher Sailaubek to test his RAG models. As you can see, it is an open-source project, so I have nothing to hide from you. I appreciate your feedback in advance.

Soon I will add how you can use my RAG algorithm in your project, but now, just enjoy this.
